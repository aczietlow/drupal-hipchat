Todo:
 * make a bot/ master page that lists installed plugins.
 * remove "Bot" preface for plugins, like "Bot Drupal URLs".
 * bring in Frando's logger as a Seen-er too.
 * add that hook that allows bot responses to be logged.
 * decide if it'll be "Bot" for hierarchy or "Bot framework".
 * add uninstall hooks: delete the database tables?
